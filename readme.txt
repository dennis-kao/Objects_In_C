This program converts a C++ like program into a valid C program.

Limitations
  Identifiers should be less than 100 characters long

  There is no support for the single word "long" data type (but there is support for the long double data type)

  Declaring multiple objects on a single line with commas is not supported
    e.g. Class B hello, world, there;
  
Compilation
  There is an included make file. Simply type "make" to get an executable named a1.

Notes
  Have mercy. 
  
  The program produces the correct output for sample1.cc and sample2.cc but not sample3.cc
